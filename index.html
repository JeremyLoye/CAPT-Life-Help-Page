                    All CAPTains are required to study five UTown College Programme (UTCP) modules during their stay in CAPT. They comprise of
                    2 Ideas &amp; Exposition (I&amp;E) modules (commonly referred to as IEMs), 1 Junior Seminar (JS), and
                    2 Senior Seminars (SS). These modules cover the General Education (GE) requirement for NUS students.
                    Note that these requirements differ for Law, Nursing and Medicine students.
                </p>
                <p class='text-body'>
                    Additionally, from AY 15/16 onwards, all NUS students are required to take GER1000 Quantitative Reasoning as part of the
                    GE requirement. For CAPTains, this means that one UTCP module will be considered as an Unrestricted Elective
                    (UE), instead of being counted as a GE module.
                </p>
                <p class='text-body'>
                    More information about modules (along with the list of modules being offered in the upcoming/current semester) can be found
                    at the CAPT official website.

                <h3 class='question' id='acadOne'>Can I use S/U on CAPT Modules?</h3>
                <p class='text-body' id='acadTwo'> All JS modules are CS/CU (i.e., pass/fail). You can S/U the rest, including Capstone.
                </p>
                <hr/>
                <h3 class='question'>What is the difference between bidding and balloting?</h3>
                <p class='text-body'>
                    You will need to bid for your faculty modules and unrestricted electives (UEs). This is done through CORS, where you use
                    points to get modules that you want.
                </p>

                <p class='text-body'>
                    On the other hand, balloting is where you rank your choices, and the school will try to give you your top few choices. This
                    is done for both CAPT modules, and for the tutorial slots for your faculty modules (after you have successfully
                    gotten your faculty modules).

                    The event should be College or Neighbourhood-related (that is, you should not be booking for your faculty, etc.). You are
                    however allowed to book the MPSH for personal use (games with friends) but the group using the MPSH must
                    be majority (more than 50%) CAPTains. Please also make your booking a few weeks in advance.

                    <br/> Working together with the RAs and Neighbourhood Committees, they play a very important role in creating
                    a secure and supportive environment for communal living and for learning. Our RFs are happy to chat about
                    their own passion, research and hobbies, or about studies and life in general. Do get to know your RF
                    through Neighbourhood bonding activities, along the corridors, or over a meal!

                    Resident Assistants (RAs) are friendly and approachable CAPTains who help to oversee the residential life aspect at CAPT.
                    There is an RA designated for each floor and you can find them in room #69 (although this may vary for
                    different floors, check with your house comm to be sure!). Having battled (and survived) at least four
                    semesters of NUS life, the RAs are people who want to share their experiences and make life better for
                    those around them.
                    <br/>
                    <br/> The RA team works throughout the year for CAPTains’ safety and wellbeing, so that everyone can enjoy
                    their time in CAPT. So, don’t hesitate to approach any RA if you need someone to talk to or for some
                    advice on university matters. They are more than happy to have a chat or heart-to-heart talk!

                    Interest groups refer to a community of CAPTains who come together with a common interest for various activities! Bonded
                    by their interest and not proficiency levels, IGs are good platforms where CAPTains can take their time

                    your idea aligns with CAPT’s vision and will greatly benefit the community within CAPT, feel free to
                    submit your ideas to the respective CSC committee directors.
                    <br/>
                    <br/> Should you wish to start a new sports IG, you may approach the Director of Sports. Otherwise, you may
                    approach the Director of Clubs and Societies for non-sports IGs. Both directors will be more than happy

                    Do you have an awesome idea you’d like to carry out? First steps of starting something new is definitely approaching like-minded

                    your initiative can be created within CAPT. Do take note of the college’s emphasis on Active Citizenship
                    and Community Engagement when you set out to formulate a new initiative. Once you have a plan, you can
                    approach the relevant Director if it clearly falls under their purview. (e.g. approach the Director of
                    ACE or SI if your initiative involves a project with a new partner)
